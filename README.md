# Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning üß†ü§ñ

> üì¢ Please review the ["Questions you must know the answers to before attending the exam"](./questions.md) document. This critical resource contains key questions that are crucial for your success in the exam.

Welcome to the official repository for the course [Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://esami.unipi.it/programma.php?c=61134&aa=2023&docente=GALATOLO&insegnamento=&sd=0).

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource hub, providing you with essential slides, materials, and exercise solutions.

## What's Inside? üìÇ

1. **Slides:** Access the presentation slides used in class to reinforce key concepts and insights.
2. **Materials:** Find supplementary materials that complement the course content, helping you delve deeper into specific topics.
3. **Exercises Solutions:** Access detailed solutions to the exercises assigned during the course to enhance your understanding of key concepts and coding practices.

## How to Navigate üó∫Ô∏è

Feel free to navigate through the repository to locate the specific resources you need. Exploring the repository is quite straightforward. Each lecture has its dedicated folder, housing a README file and associated materials for your convenience.

## Unlocking Solutions üîì

The solutions for the exercises are locked and will require a password to access. After each lecture, the lecturer will provide the necessary password to unlock the relevant solutions. You can use the `lock.py` script to unlock these files by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the repository directory.
2. Run the following command: `python lock.py unlock <Lecture Number>`
3. Enter the password provided by the lecturer to unlock the solutions.

Replace `<Lecture Number>` with the relevant lecture (e.g., `Lecture 1`).

If successful, you will gain access to the exercise solutions for that lecture. Remember to keep the passwords secure and only share them with those who are enrolled in the course **this year**.

Keep in mind that the files are stored in a `lock.zip` file inside each lecture directory, and you can also extract the zip manually using any zip extraction program.
